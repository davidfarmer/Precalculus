      In many instances in the sciences,
      equations are encountered as a result of fundamental natural laws which are typically a result of assuming certain basic relationships between variables.
      These basic relationships are summarized in the definition below.

                There is a bit of ambiguity here.
                It's clear that the volume and the height of the cone are represented by the quantities <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>,
                respectively,
                but does <m>r</m> represent the radius of the base or the square of the radius of the base?
                It is the former.
                Usually, if an algebraic operation is specified
                (like squaring),
                it is meant to be expressed in the formula.
                We apply <xref ref="variation">Definition</xref> to get <m>V = k h r^{2}</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even though the problem doesn't use the phrase <sq>varies jointly</sq>,
                it is implied by the fact that the current <m>I</m> is related to two different quantities.
                Since <m>I</m> varies directly with <m>V</m> but inversely with <m>R</m>,
                we write <m>I = \frac{k V}{R}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We write the product of the masses <m>mM</m> and the square of the distance as <m>r^2</m>.
                We have that <m>F</m> varies directly with <m>mM</m> and inversely with <m>r^2</m>,
                so <m>F = \frac{kmM}{r^2}</m>.
              </p>

    </example>
    <p>
      A note about units is in order.
      The formulas given in <xref ref="variationexample">Example</xref>
      above all have quantities from the
      <q>real world</q>
      and we would disappoint our friends who teach Science if we didn't remind you to pay attention to units when working with these equations.
      The natural question that arises is
      <q>What units does <m>k</m> have?</q>
      The answer is
      <q>whatever works</q>
      and by that we mean the units on <m>k</m> will be whatever it takes to make the equation have the same units on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, in Hooke's Law we have that <m>F = kx</m>.
      If <m>F</m> is in newtons and <m>x</m> is in meters then <m>k</m> must be in <m>\frac{\text{ newton } }{\text{ meter } }</m>.
      This can lead to some odd sounding units,
      such as the units on the constant <m>R</m> in the Ideal Gas Law <m>PV = nRT</m>
      (see <xref ref="idealgasexercise">Exercise</xref>)
      or no units at all
      (see <xref ref="coneexercisenounits">Exercise</xref>).
      Unit conversions can mess things up as well - see <xref ref="coneexercisebadunits">Exercise</xref>
      for a sample of that kind of nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      We end this section with an example that first requires us to find the value of <m>k</m> and then use it to solve another problem.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="findingkinvariation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose it takes 11 pounds of force to hold a spring 2 inches beyond its natural length.
          What force is required to hold it 7 inches beyond natural length?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Using Hooke's Law with <m>F = 11</m> pounds and <m>x = 2</m> inches we solve
          <m>11 = k*2</m> for <m>k</m> and find <m>k = 5.5 \frac{\text{ pound } }{\text{ inch } }</m>.
          Setting <m>x = 7</m> in Hooke's Law with <m>k = 5.5</m> yields
          <m>F = 5.5*7 = 38.5</m> pounds of force. (Check the units to convince yourself that this worked!)
