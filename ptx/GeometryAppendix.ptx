  <title>Geometry Review</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The authors really wanted the Trigonometry portion of Precalculus, Episode IV to start with the definitions of the circular functions so one purpose of this Geometry Review Appendix is to find a home for the material that is prerequisite to those definitions.
      Another reason for this Appendix is to further support a
      <q>co-requisite</q>
      approach to teaching a Precalculus<fn>
      Remember how we define
      <q>Precalculus</q>
      - to us, Precalculus = College Algebra + College Trigonometry without formal limits.
      In order to fully support a
      <q>co-requisite</q>
      approach to a class that has Trigonometry in it,
      we felt it necessary to provide some material to assist students who have gaps in their Geometry background.
      The careful reader will note that all of this material was in the main body of our third edition so it can be included nearly seemlessly into a regular Trigonometry class.
      </fn> class.
      As is the case with the Algebra Review Appendix,
      this chapter is not designed for students who have never seen this material before.
      In fact, our treatment of Geometry is even more brief than that of Algebra because we assume a student who is taking a stand alone college-level Trigonometry class is already proficient in College Algebra,
      and those learning the Trigonometry portion of a full Precalculus class have ostensibly survived the College Algebra portion.
      Thus we review only some very basic concepts covered in a typical high school Geometry course.
      Where appropriate,
      we have referenced specific sections of the main body of the Precalculus text in an effort to assist faculty who would like to assign the Appendix as
      <q>just in time</q>
      review reading to their students.
      This Appendix contains two sections which are briefly described below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="AppAngles">Section</xref>
      (Angles in Degrees) is a brief review of some of the terminology and concepts from a typical high school Geometry course.
      Radian measure is deferred until <xref ref="FoundationsofTrigonometry">Chapter</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="AppRightTrig">Section</xref>
      (Basic Right Triangle Trigonometry) defines the trigonometric functions in the context of a right triangle using angles measured in degrees.
      Basic applications are discussed and a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is given but trigonometric identities are deferred until <xref ref="FoundationsofTrigonometry">Chapter</xref>.
