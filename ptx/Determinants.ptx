    <title>Definition and Properties of the Determinant</title>
    <p>
      In this section we assign to each square matrix <m>A</m> a real number,
      called the <em>determinant</em> of <m>A</m>,
      which will eventually lead us to yet another technique for solving consistent independent systems of linear equations.
      The determinant is defined recursively, that is,
      we define it for <m>1 \times 1</m> matrices and give a rule by which we can reduce determinants of
      <m>n \times n</m> matrices to a sum of determinants of <m>(n-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrices.<fn>
      We will talk more about the term <sq>recursively</sq> in <xref ref="Sequences">Section</xref>.
      </fn> This means we will be able to evaluate the determinant of a
      <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix as a sum of the determinants of <m>1 \times 1</m> matrices;
      the determinant of a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix as a sum of the determinants of
      <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To explain how we will take an
      <m>n \times n</m> matrix and distill an <m>(n-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix from it,
      we use introduce the following notation.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="Aijdefn">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> where <m>n>1</m>,
          the matrix <m>A_{ij}</m> is the
          <m>(n-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix formed by deleting the <m>i</m>th row of <m>A</m> and the <m>j</m>th column of <m>A</m>.

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For the matrix <m>A</m> below,
      we obtain <m>A_{23}</m> by deleting the second row and third column of <m>A</m>:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{ccc}  A = \left[ \begin{array}{rr>{\columncolor[gray]{0.7}}r} 3 \amp   1 \amp  2 \\ \rowcolor[gray]{0.7} 0 \amp  -1 \amp  5 \\ 2 \amp  1 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right] \amp \xrightarrow{\text{ Delete \(R2\) and \(C3\) } }  \amp  A_{23} = \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 3 \amp  1 \\ 2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right] \end{array}

      We are now in the position to define the determinant of a matrix.

      There are two commonly used notations for the determinant of a matrix <m>A</m>:
      <sq><m>\det(A)</m></sq> and <sq><m>|A|</m></sq> We have chosen to use the notation <m>\det(A)</m> as opposed to <m>|A|</m> because we find that the latter is often confused with absolute value,
      especially in the context of a <m>1 \times 1</m> matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the expansion <m>a_{11} \det\left(A_{11}\right)- a_{12} \det\left(A_{12}\right) + - \ldots + (-1)^{1+n} a_{1n} \det\left(A_{1n}\right)</m>,
      the notation <sq><m>+ - \ldots + (-1)^{1+n} a_{1n}</m></sq> means that the signs alternate and the final sign is dictated by the sign of the quantity <m>(-1)^{1+n}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the entries <m>a_{11}</m>,
      <m>a_{12}</m> and so forth up through <m>a_{1n}</m> comprise the first row of <m>A</m>,
      we say we are finding the determinant of <m>A</m> by <sq>expanding along the first row</sq>.
      Later in the section,
      we will develop a formula for <m>\det(A)</m> which allows us to find it by expanding along any row.

      Applying <xref ref="determinantdefn">Definition</xref>
      to the matrix <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 4 \amp  -3 \\ 2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right]</m> we get
      <me>
        \begin{array}{rcl}  \det(A) \amp  = \amp  \det \left( \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 4 \amp  -3 \\ 2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right] \right)\\ \amp  = \amp    4\det\left(A_{11}\right) - (-3)\det\left(A_{12}\right)\\ \amp  = \amp  4 \det([1]) +3\det([2]) \\ \amp  = \amp  4(1) + 3(2) \\ \amp  = \amp  10 \end{array}

      For a generic <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a \amp  b \\ c \amp  d \end{array}  \right]</m> we get

      To evaluate the determinant of a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix,
      we would have to evaluate the determinants of <em>four</em>
      <m>3 \times 3</m> matrices,
      each of which involves the finding the determinants of
      <em>three</em> <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices.
      As you can see,
      our method of evaluating determinants quickly gets out of hand and many of you may be reaching for the calculator.
      There is some mathematical machinery which can assist us in calculating determinants and we present that here.
      Before we state the theorem, we need some more terminology.

      Unfortunately, while we can easily <em>demonstrate</em>
      the results in <xref ref="determinantprops">Theorem</xref>,
      the proofs of most of these properties are beyond the scope of this text.
      We could prove these properties for generic <m>2 \times 2</m> or even
      <m>3 \times 3</m> matrices by brute force computation,
      but this manner of proof belies the elegance and symmetry of the determinant.
      We will prove what few properties we can after we have developed some more tools such as the Principle of Mathematical Induction in <xref ref="Induction">Section</xref>.<fn>
      For a very elegant treatment,
      take a course in Linear Algebra.
      There, you will most likely see the treatment of determinants logically reversed than what is presented here.
      Specifically,
      the determinant is defined as a function which takes a square matrix to a real number and satisfies some of the properties in <xref ref="determinantprops">Theorem</xref>.
      From that function, a formula for the determinant is developed.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment,
      let us demonstrate some of the properties listed in <xref ref="determinantprops">Theorem</xref> on the matrix <m>A</m> below.
      (Others will be discussed in the Exercises.)

        A =  \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} 3 \amp  1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  -1 \amp  5 \\ 2 \amp  1 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right]

      We found <m>\det(A) = -13</m> by expanding along the first row.
      To take advantage of the <m>0</m> in the second row,
      we use <xref ref="determinantprops">Theorem</xref>
      to find <m>\det(A) = -13</m> by expanding along that row.

        \begin{array}{rcl}  \det \left( \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} 3 \amp  1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  -1 \amp  5 \\ 2 \amp  1 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right] \right)\amp  = \amp  0C_{21} + (-1)C_{22}+5C_{23} \\  \amp  = \amp   (-1) (-1)^{2+2} \det\left(A_{22}\right) + 5 (-1)^{2+3}\det\left(A_{23}\right) \\  \amp  = \amp  - \det \left( \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 3 \amp  2 \\ 2 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right] \right) -5 \det \left( \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 3 \amp  1 \\ 2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right] \right) \\ \amp  = \amp  -((3)(4)-(2)(2)) - 5((3)(1)-(2)(1)) \\ \amp  = \amp  -8-5 \\ \amp  = \amp  -13 \, \, \checkmark \end{array}

      In general, the sign of <m>(-1)^{i+j}</m> in front of the minor in the expansion of the determinant follows an alternating pattern.
      Below is the pattern for <m>2 \times 2</m>,
      <m>3 \times 3</m> and <m>4 \times 4</m> matrices,
      and it extends naturally to higher dimensions.
      <me>
        \begin{array}{ccc}  \left[ \begin{array}{cc} + \amp  - \\ - \amp  + \end{array}  \right]  \amp \qquad  \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} + \amp  - \amp  + \\ - \amp  + \amp  - \\ + \amp  - \amp  + \end{array}  \right]   \amp  \qquad  \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  - \\ - \amp  + \amp  - \amp  +\\ + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  - \\ - \amp  + \amp  - \amp  + \end{array}  \right] \end{array}

    </p>
    <p>
      The reader is cautioned,
      however, against reading too much into these sign patterns.
      In the example above, we expanded the
      <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m> by its second row and the term which corresponds to the second entry ended up being negative even though the sign attached to the minor is <m>(+)</m>.
      These signs represent only the signs of the <m>(-1)^{i+j}</m> in the formula;
      the sign of the corresponding entry as well as the minor itself determine the ultimate sign of the term in the expansion of the determinant.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate some of the other properties in <xref ref="determinantprops">Theorem</xref>,
      we use row operations to transform our
      <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m> into an upper triangular matrix,
      keeping track of the row operations,
      and labeling each successive matrix.
      In what follows we follow the Gauss Jordan algorithm without worrying about getting leading <m>1</m>'s.

      <xref ref="determinantprops">Theorem</xref>
      guarantees us that <m>\det(A) = \det(B) = \det(C)</m> since we are replacing a row with itself plus a multiple of another row moving from one matrix to the next.
      Furthermore, since <m>C</m> is upper triangular,
      <m>\det(C)</m> is the product of the entries on the main diagonal,
      in this case <m>\det(C) = (3)(-1)\left(\frac{13}{3}\right) = -13</m>.
      This demonstrates the utility of using row operations to assist in calculating determinants.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also sheds some light on the connection between a determinant and invertibility.
      Recall from <xref ref="MatMethods">Section</xref>
      that in order to find <m>A^{-1}</m>,
      we attempt to transform <m>A</m> to <m>I_{n}</m> using row operations
      <me>
        \begin{array}{ccc}  \left[ \begin{array}{c|c} A \amp  I_{n} \end{array}  \right]  \amp \xrightarrow{\text{ Gauss Jordan Elimination } }  \amp  \left[ \begin{array}{c|c} I_{n} \amp  A^{-1} \end{array}  \right] \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      As we apply our allowable row operations on <m>A</m> to put it into reduced row echelon form,
      the determinant of the intermediate matrices can vary from the determinant of <m>A</m> by at most a
      <em>nonzero</em> multiple.
      This means that if <m>\det(A) \neq 0</m>,
      then the determinant of <m>A</m>'s reduced row echelon form must also be nonzero.
      Per <xref ref="rowechelonform">Definition</xref>,
      this means that all the main diagonal entries on <m>A</m>'s reduced row echelon form must be <m>1</m>.
      Hence, <m>A</m>'s reduced row echelon form is <m>I_{n}</m> so <m>A</m> is invertible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, if <m>A</m> is invertible,
      then <m>A</m> can be transformed into <m>I_{n}</m> using row operations.
      Since <m>\det\left(I_{n}\right) = 1 \neq 0</m>,
      our same logic implies <m>\det(A) \neq 0</m>.
      Basically, we have established that the determinant <em>determines</em>
      whether or not the matrix <m>A</m> is invertible.<fn>
      In <xref ref="CramersRuleMatrixAdjoints">Section</xref>,
      we learn determinants
      (specifically cofactors)
      are deeply connected with the inverse of a matrix.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that when we first introduced the notion of a matrix inverse,
      it was in the context of solving a linear matrix equation.
      In effect, we were trying to <sq>divide</sq> both sides of the matrix equation <m>AX = B</m> by the matrix <m>A</m>.
      Just like we cannot divide a real number by <m>0</m>,
      <xref ref="determinantprops">Theorem</xref>
      tells us we cannot <sq>divide</sq> by a matrix whose
      <em>determinant</em> is <m>0</m>.
      We also know that if the coefficient matrix of a system of linear equations is invertible,
      then system is consistent and independent.
      It follows, then,
      that if the determinant of said coefficient is not zero,
      the system is consistent and independent.

    <title>Cramer's Rule and Matrix Adjoints</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we introduce a theorem which enables us to solve a system of linear equations by means of determinants only.
      As usual, the theorem is stated in full generality,
      using numbered unknowns <m>x_{1}</m>, <m>x_{2}</m>,
      etc., instead of the more familiar letters <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>,
      <m>z</m>, etc.
      As with many results in this chapter,
      the proof of the general case is best left to a course in Linear Algebra.

        <p>
          If <m>\det(A) \neq 0</m>,

      In words, Cramer's Rule tells us we can solve for each unknown,
      one at a time,
      by finding the ratio of the determinant of <m>A_{j}</m> to that of the determinant of the coefficient matrix.
      The matrix <m>A_{j}</m> is found by replacing the column in the coefficient matrix which holds the coefficients of <m>x_{j}</m> with the constants of the system.
      The following example fleshes out this method.

                To find the matrix <m>A_{1}</m>,
                we remove the column of the coefficient matrix <m>A</m> which holds the coefficients of <m>x_{1}</m> and replace it with the corresponding entries in <m>B</m>.
                Likewise, we replace the column of <m>A</m> which corresponds to the coefficients of <m>x_{2}</m> with the constants to form the matrix <m>A_{2}</m>.
                This yields

                Computing determinants, we get <m>\det(A) = 17</m>,

                Expanding both <m>\det(A)</m> and <m>\det\left(A_{z}\right)</m> along the third rows
                (to take advantage of the <m>0</m>'s)
                gives

      It is worth noting that finding determinants is very <sq>computationally expensive</sq> meaning they take quite a bit of time and effort to compute for humans and machines alike.
      For that reason, determinants, and,
      in particular, Cramer's Rule are used mostly in theoretical contexts as convenient ways to describe and discuss solutions to systems of linear equations.<fn>
      A classic case of this is the
      <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wronskian"><em>Wronskian</em></url>
      from Differential Equations.
      </fn>

      Our last application of determinants is to develop an alternative method for finding the inverse of a matrix.
      As with the discussion in <xref ref="MatMethods">Section</xref>
      when we developed the first algorithm to find matrix inverses,
      we ask that you indulge us as we proceed to work to describe a <em>general</em>
      method here via <em>example</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us consider the <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m> which we so extensively studied in <xref ref="determinantdefnandprops">Section</xref>
      <me>
        A = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} 3 \amp  1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  -1 \amp  5 \\ 2 \amp  1 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We found through a variety of methods that <m>\det(A) = -13</m>.
      To our surprise and delight,
      its inverse below has a remarkable number of <m>13</m>'s in the denominators of its entries.
      This is no coincidence.
      <me>
        A^{-1} = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} \frac{9}{13} \amp  \frac{2}{13} \amp  -\frac{7}{13} \\ -\frac{10}{13} \amp  -\frac{8}{13} \amp  \frac{15}{13} \\ -\frac{2}{13} \amp  \frac{1}{13} \amp  \frac{3}{13} \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that to find <m>A^{-1}</m>,
      we are essentially solving the matrix equation <m>AX = I_{3}</m>,
      where <m>X = \left[ x_{ij} \right]_{3 \times 3}</m> is a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix.
      Because of how matrix multiplication is defined,
      the first column of <m>I_{3}</m> is the product of <m>A</m> with the first column of <m>X</m>,
      the second column of <m>I_{3}</m> is the product of <m>A</m> with the second column of <m>X</m> and the third column of <m>I_{3}</m> is the product of <m>A</m> with the third column of <m>X</m>.
      In other words, we are solving three equations<fn>
      The reader is encouraged to stop and think this through.
      </fn>
      <me>
        \begin{array}{ccc}  A\left[ \begin{array}{r} x_{11} \\ x_{21} \\ x_{31} \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]  \amp \qquad A\left[ \begin{array}{r} x_{12} \\ x_{22} \\ x_{32} \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]  \amp  \qquad  A\left[ \begin{array}{r} x_{13} \\ x_{23} \\ x_{33} \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}  \right] \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can solve each of these systems using Cramer's Rule.
      Focusing on the first system, we have
      <me>
        \begin{array}{ccc}  A_{1} = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} 1 \amp  1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  -1 \amp  5 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right]  \amp  A_{2} = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} 3 \amp   1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  5 \\ 2 \amp  0 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right]  \amp  A_{3} = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} 3 \amp   1 \amp  1 \\ 0 \amp  -1 \amp  0 \\ 2 \amp  1 \amp  0 \end{array}  \right] \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we expand <m>\det\left(A_{1}\right)</m> along the first row, we get
      <me>
        \begin{array}{rcl}  \det\left(A_{1}\right) \amp  = \amp   \det\left( \left[ \begin{array}{rr} -1 \amp  5 \\ 1 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right] \right) - \det\left( \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 0 \amp  5 \\ 0 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right] \right) + 2 \det\left( \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 0 \amp  -1 \\ 0 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right] \right) \\  \amp  = \amp  \det\left( \left[ \begin{array}{rr} -1 \amp  5 \\ 1 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right] \right) \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazingly, this is none other than the <m>C_{11}</m> cofactor of <m>A</m>.
      The reader is invited to check this,
      as well as the claims that
      <m>\det\left(A_{2}\right) = C_{12}</m> and <m>\det\left(A_{3}\right) = C_{13}</m>.<fn>
      In a solid Linear Algebra course you will learn that the properties in <xref ref="determinantprops">Theorem</xref>
      hold equally well if the word <sq>row</sq> is replaced by the word <sq>column</sq>.
      We're not going to get into column operations in this text,
      but they do make some of what we're trying to say easier to follow.
      </fn> (To see this,
      though it seems unnatural to do so,
      expand along the first row.) Cramer's Rule tells us
      <me>
        \begin{array}{ccc}  x_{11} = \dfrac{\det\left(A_{1}\right)}{\det(A)} = \dfrac{C_{11}}{\det(A)}, \amp x_{21} = \dfrac{\det\left(A_{2}\right)}{\det(A)}  = \dfrac{C_{12}}{\det(A)}, \amp x_{31} = \dfrac{\det\left(A_{3}\right)}{\det(A)} = \dfrac{C_{13}}{\det(A)} \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So the first column of the inverse matrix <m>X</m> is:
      <me>
        \left[ \begin{array}{r} x_{11} \\ x_{21} \\ x_{31} \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} \dfrac{C_{11}}{\det(A)} \\  \dfrac{C_{12}}{\det(A)} \\ \dfrac{C_{13}}{\det(A)} \end{array}  \right] = \dfrac{1}{\det(A)} \left[ \begin{array}{r} C_{11} \\ C_{12} \\ C_{13} \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the reversal of the subscripts going from the unknown to the corresponding cofactor of <m>A</m>.
      This trend continues and we get
      <me>
        \begin{array}{cc}  \left[ \begin{array}{r} x_{12} \\ x_{22} \\ x_{32} \end{array}  \right] =  \dfrac{1}{\det(A)} \left[ \begin{array}{r} C_{21} \\ C_{22} \\ C_{23} \end{array}  \right]  \amp \qquad  \left[ \begin{array}{r} x_{13} \\ x_{23} \\ x_{33} \end{array}  \right] =  \dfrac{1}{\det(A)} \left[ \begin{array}{r} C_{31} \\ C_{32} \\ C_{33} \end{array}  \right] \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting all of these together,
      we have obtained a new and surprising formula for <m>A^{-1}</m>, namely
      <me>
        A^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{\det(A)} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} C_{11} \amp  C_{21} \amp  C_{31} \\ C_{12} \amp  C_{22} \amp  C_{32} \\ C_{13} \amp  C_{23} \amp  C_{33} \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      To see that this does indeed yield <m>A^{-1}</m>,
      we find all of the cofactors of <m>A</m>
      <me>
        \begin{array}{rcrrcrrcr}  C_{11} \amp  = \amp  -9, \amp  C_{21} \amp  = \amp  -2, \amp  C_{31} \amp  = \amp  7\\  C_{12} \amp  = \amp  10, \amp  C_{22} \amp  = \amp  8, \amp  C_{32} \amp  = \amp  -15 \\  C_{13} \amp  = \amp   2,  \amp  C_{23} \amp  = \amp  -1,  \amp  C_{33} \amp  = \amp  -3 \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as promised,
      <me>
        A^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{\det(A)} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} C_{11} \amp  C_{21} \amp  C_{31} \\ C_{12} \amp  C_{22} \amp  C_{32} \\ C_{13} \amp  C_{23} \amp  C_{33} \end{array}  \right] = -\dfrac{1}{13} \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} -9 \amp  -2 \amp  7\\ 10 \amp  8 \amp  -15 \\ 2  \amp   -1 \amp   -3 \end{array}  \right]  =  \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} \frac{9}{13} \amp  \frac{2}{13} \amp  -\frac{7}{13} \\ -\frac{10}{13} \amp  -\frac{8}{13} \amp  \frac{15}{13} \\ -\frac{2}{13} \amp  \frac{1}{13} \amp  \frac{3}{13} \end{array}  \right]

      To generalize this to invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrices,
      we need another definition and a theorem.

      The proof of <xref ref="adjointinverse">Theorem</xref> is,
      like so many of the results in this section,
      best left to a course in Linear Algebra.
      In such a course,
      not only do you gain some more sophisticated proof techniques,
      you also gain a larger perspective.
      Within the scope of this text,
      we will prove a few results involving determinants in <xref ref="Induction">Section</xref>
      using the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
      Until then, make sure you have a handle on the <em>mechanics</em>
      of matrices and the theory will come eventually.

      The purpose of <xref ref="eigenfirst">Exercises</xref>
      - <xref ref="eigenlast"></xref>
      is to introduce you to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.<fn>
      This material is usually given its own chapter in a Linear Algebra book so clearly we're not able to tell you everything you need to know about eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
      They are a nice application of determinants, though,
      so we're going to give you enough background so that you can start playing around with them.
      </fn> We begin with an example using a
      <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix and then guide you through some exercises using a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix.
      Consider the matrix
      <me>
        C = \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 6 \amp  15 \\ 14 \amp  35 \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
      from <xref ref="matrixC">Exercise</xref>.
      We know that <m>\det(C) = 0</m> which means that
      <m>CX = 0_{2\times2}</m> does not have a unique solution.
      So there is a nonzero matrix <m>Y</m> with <m>CY = 0_{2\times2}</m>.
      In fact, every matrix of the form
      <me>
        Y = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -\frac{5}{2}t \\ t \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
      is a solution to <m>CX = 0_{2\times2}</m>,
      so there are infinitely many matrices such that <m>CX = 0_{2\times2}</m>.
      But consider the matrix
      <me>
        X_{41} = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 3 \\ 7 \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is NOT a solution to <m>CX = 0_{2\times2}</m>, but rather,
      <me>
        CX_{41}= \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 6 \amp  15 \\ 14 \amp  35 \end{array}  \right] \left[ \begin{array}{r} 3 \\ 7 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 123 \\ 287 \end{array}  \right] = 41\left[ \begin{array}{r} 3 \\ 7 \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, if <m>Z</m> is of the form
      <me>
        Z = \left[ \begin{array}{r} \frac{3}{7}t \\ t \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
      then
      <me>
        CZ = \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 6 \amp  15 \\ 14 \amp  35 \end{array}  \right] \left[ \begin{array}{r} \frac{3}{7}t \\ t \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} \frac{123}{7}t \\ 41t \end{array}  \right] = 41\left[ \begin{array}{r} \frac{3}{7}t \\ t \end{array}  \right] = 41Z
      </me>
      for all <m>t</m>.
      The big question is
      <q>How did we know to use <m>41</m>?</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      We need a number <m>\lambda</m> such that
      <m>CX = \lambda X</m> has nonzero solutions.
      We have demonstrated that <m>\lambda = 0</m> and <m>\lambda = 41</m> both worked.
      Are there others?
      If we look at the matrix equation more closely,
      what we <em>really</em> wanted was a nonzero solution to
      <m>(C - \lambda I_{2})X = 0_{2\times2}</m> which we know exists if and only if the determinant of <m>C - \lambda I_{2}</m> is zero.<fn>

      </fn> So we computed
      <me>
        \det(C - \lambda I_{2}) = \det\left(\left[ \begin{array}{rr} 6 - \lambda \amp  15 \\ 14 \amp  35 - \lambda \end{array}  \right] \right) = (6 - \lambda)(35 - \lambda) - 14 \cdot 15 = \lambda^{2} - 41 \lambda

      This is called the <em>characteristic polynomial</em>
          <idx><h>characteristic polynomial</h></idx>
          <idx><h>matrix</h><h>characteristic polynomial</h></idx>
      of the matrix <m>C</m> and it has two zeros:
      <m>\lambda = 0</m> and <m>\lambda = 41</m>.
      That's how we knew to use <m>41</m> in our work above.
      The fact that <m>\lambda = 0</m> showed up as one of the zeros of the characteristic polynomial just means that <m>C</m> itself had determinant zero which we already knew.
      Those two numbers are called the
      <em>eigenvalues</em> of <m>C</m>.
      The corresponding matrix solutions to
      <m>CX = \lambda X</m> are called the <em>eigenvectors</em>
      of <m>C</m> and the <sq>vector</sq> portion of the name will make more sense after you've studied vectors.
          <idx><h>eigenvalue</h></idx>
          <idx><h>eigenvector</h></idx>

          Using Cramer's Rule,
          we find we need 53 servings of Ippizuti Fish to satisfy the dietary requirements.
          The number of servings of Misty Mushrooms required, however,
          is <m>-1120</m>.
          Since it's impossible to have a negative number of servings,
          there is no solution to the applied problem,
          despite there being a solution to the mathematical problem.
          A cautionary tale about using Cramer's Rule:
          just because you are guaranteed a mathematical answer for each variable doesn't mean the solution will make sense in the <sq>real</sq> world.
