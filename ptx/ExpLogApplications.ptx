  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we mentioned in <xref ref="ExponentialFunctions">Sections</xref>
      and <xref ref="LogarithmicFunctions"></xref>,
      exponential and logarithmic functions are used to model a wide variety of behaviors in the real world.
      In the examples that follow,
      note that while the applications are drawn from many different disciplines,
      the mathematics remains essentially the same.
      Due to the applied nature of the problems we will examine in this section,
      we will often express our final answers as decimal approximations (after finding exact answers first,
      of course!)

    <title>Applications of Exponential Functions</title>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most well-known application of exponential functions comes from the financial world.
      Suppose you have <m>$ 100</m> to invest at your local bank and they are offering a whopping <m>5 \, \%</m> annual percentage interest rate.
      This means that after one year,
      the bank will pay <em>you</em> <m>5 \%</m> of that <m>\dollar100</m>,
      or <m>$ 100(0.05) =$ 5</m> in interest,
      so you now have <m>\dollar105</m>.
      This is in accordance with the formula for
      <em>simple interest</em>
      which you have undoubtedly run across at some point before.

    </proposition>
    <p>
      Suppose, however, that six months into the year,
      you hear of a better deal at a rival bank.<fn>
      Some restrictions may apply.
      </fn> Naturally,
      you withdraw your money and try to invest it at the higher rate there.
      Since six months is one half of a year,
      that initial <m>\dollar100</m> yields <m>\dollar100(0.05)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = $ 2.50</m> in interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You take your <m>\dollar102.50</m> off to the competitor and find out that those restrictions which <em>may</em>
      apply actually <em>do</em> apply,
      so you return to your bank and re-deposit the
      <m>\dollar102.50</m> for the remaining six months of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      To your surprise and delight,
      at the end of the year your statement reads <m>\dollar105.06</m>,
      not <m>\dollar105</m> as you had expected.<fn>
      Actually, the final balance should be <m>\dollar105.0625</m>.
      </fn> Where did those extra six cents come from?
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first six months of the year,
      interest was earned on the original principal of <m>\dollar100</m>,
      but for the second six months,
      interest was earned on <m>\dollar102.50</m>, that is,
      you earned interest on your interest.
      This is the basic concept behind
      <em>compound interest</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the previous discussion,
      we would say that the interest was compounded twice per year,
      or semiannually.<fn>
      Using this convention,
      simple interest after one year is the same as compounding the interest only once.
      </fn> If more money can be earned by earning interest on interest already earned,
      one wonders what happens if the interest is compounded more often,
      say every three months - <m>4</m> times a year, or <sq>quarterly.</sq>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, the money is in the account for three months,
      or <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of a year, at a time.
      After the first quarter,
      we have <m>A = P(1+rt) = \dollar100 \left(1 + 0.05 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \right) = \dollar101.25</m>.
      We now invest the <m>\dollar101.25</m> for the next three months and find that at the end of the second quarter,
      we have <m>A = \dollar101.25 \left(1 + 0.05 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \right)\approx \dollar102.51</m>.
      Continuing in this manner,
      the balance at the end of the third quarter is <m>\dollar103.79</m>,
      and, at last,
      we obtain <m>\dollar105.08</m>.
      The extra two cents hardly seems worth it,
      but we see that we do in fact get more money the more often we compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to develop a formula for this phenomenon,
      we need to do some abstract calculations.
      Suppose we wish to invest our principal <m>P</m> at an annual rate <m>r</m> and compound the interest <m>n</m> times per year.
      This means the money sits in the account
      <m>\frac{1}{n}^{\mbox{\tiny th} }</m> of a year between compoundings.
      Let <m>A_{k}</m> denote the amount in the account after the <m>k^{\mbox{\tiny th} }</m> compounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then <m>A_{1} = P\left(1 + r\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right)</m> which simplifies to <m>A_{1} = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)</m>.
      After the second compounding,
      we use <m>A_{1}</m> as our new principal and get <m>A_{2} = A_{1} \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right) = \left[P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)\right]\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right) = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^2</m>.
      Continuing in this fashion,
      we get <m>A_{3} =P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^3</m>,
      <m>A_{4} =P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^4</m>,
      and so on, so that <m>A_{k} = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^k</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we compound the interest <m>n</m> times per year,
      after <m>t</m> years, we have <m>nt</m> compoundings.
      We have just derived the general formula for compound interest below.

      becomes <m>A(t) = 100\left(1+ \frac{0.05}{4}\right)^{4t}</m> which reduces to <m>A(t) = 100(1.0125)^{4t}</m>.
      To check this new formula against our previous calculations,
      we find <m>A\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = 100(1.0125)^{4 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)} = 101.25</m>,

                Our initial investment is <m>\dollar2000</m>,

                That is, we need to solve <m>2000 (1.0059375)^{12t}=4000</m>,
                or <m>(1.0059375)^{12t}=2</m>.
                Taking natural logs as in <xref ref="ExponentialEquationsandInequalities">Section</xref>,
                we get <m>t = \frac{\ln(2)}{12 \ln(1.0059375)} \approx 9.75</m>.

                      The average rate of change of <m>A</m> from the end of the fourth year to the end of the fifth year is <m>\frac{A(5)-A(4)}{5-4} \approx 195.63</m>.
                      This means that the value of the investment is increasing at a rate of approximately
                      <m>\dollar195.63</m> per year between the end of the fourth and fifth years.

                      Likewise, the average rate of change of <m>A</m> from the end of the thirty-fourth year to the end of the thirty-fifth year is <m>\frac{A(35)-A(34)}{35-34} \approx 1648.21</m>,
                      so the value of the investment is increasing at a rate of approximately

              So, not only is it true that the longer you wait, the more money you have,
              but also the longer you wait,
              the faster the money increases.<fn>
              In fact, the rate of increase of the amount in the account is exponential as well.
              This is the quality that really defines exponential functions and we refer the reader to a course in Calculus.

                      This means that the amount in the account is increasing at a rate of approximately

                      This means that the percentage growth from the thirty-fourth to thirty-fifth year is <m>7.362 \%</m>,
                      the same as the percentage growth from the fourth to the fifth year.

              We know from the remarks following <xref ref="rrc">Definition</xref>
              that for exponential functions,
              the relative rate of change over an interval of length <m>1</m> is constant and,
              moreover,
              is equal to <m>b-1</m> where <m>b</m> is the base of the exponential function,
              <m>f(x) = a \cdot b^{x}</m>.
              In our scenario,
              <m>A(t) = 2000 (1.0059375)^{12t} = 2000 \left[(1.0059375)^{12}\right]^{t} = 2000 \cdot (1.07362 \ldots)^t</m>.
              Hence, the base is <m>b = 1.07362 \ldots</m> and the relative rate of change is <m>b-1 = 0.07362 \ldots</m>.
              Note that the interest rate quoted to us at the beginning of this problem is <m>7.125 \%</m> per year.
              The rate <m>7.362 \%</m> is called the <sq><em>effective</em></sq> interest rate which factors in the effect of the compounding on the growth of the investment.

      We have observed that the more times you compound the interest per year,
      the more money you will earn in a year.
      Let's push this notion to the limit.<fn>

      you'll be able to fully appreciate this very lame pun.

      As promised, the more compoundings per year,
      the more money there is in the account,
      but we also observe that the increase in money is greatly diminishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are witnessing a mathematical <sq>tug of war</sq>.
      While we are compounding more times per year,
      and hence getting interest on our interest more often,
      the amount of time between compoundings is getting smaller and smaller,
      so there is less time to build up additional interest.

          <idx><h>rate of change</h><h>instantaneous</h></idx>
      rate at which a population increases at any time is directly proportional to the population at that time.<fn>
      The average rate of change of a function over an interval was first introduced in <xref ref="ConstantandLinearFunctions">Section</xref>.

      Formulating the law as stated results in a differential equation,

      It is worth taking some time to compare <xref ref="continuouscompoundinterest">Equations</xref>

      In <xref ref="continuouscompoundinterest">Equation</xref>,

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In order to perform arthrosclerosis research,
          epithelial cells are harvested from discarded umbilical tissue and grown in the laboratory.
          A technician observes that a culture of twelve thousand cells grows to five million cells in one week.
          Assuming that the cells follow The Law of Uninhibited Growth,
          find a formula for the number of cells, in thousands,
          after <m>t</m> days, <m>N(t)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We begin with <m>N(t) = N_{0}e^{kt}</m>.
          Since <m>N(t)</m> is to give the number of cells <em>in thousands</em>,
          we have <m>N_{0} = 12</m>, so <m>N(t) = 12e^{kt}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we need to determine the growth rate <m>k</m>.
          We know that after one week, the number of cells has grown to five million.
          Since <m>t</m> measures days and the units of <m>N(t)</m> are in thousands,
          this translates mathematically to
          <m>N(7) = 5000</m> or <m>12e^{7k} = 5000</m>.
          Solving, we get <m>k = \frac{1}{7} \ln\left(\frac{1250}{3}\right)</m>,
          so <m>N(t) = 12e^{ \frac{t}{7} \ln\left(\frac{1250}{3}\right)}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, in practice,
          we would approximate <m>k</m> to some desired accuracy,
          say <m>k \approx 0.8618</m>,
          which we can interpret as an
          <m>86.18 \%</m> daily growth rate for the cells.

      One example we've seen already is <xref ref="cardepreciationex">Example</xref>

      Another real world phenomenon which follows suit is radioactive decay.
      There are elements which are unstable and emit energy spontaneously.
      In doing so, the amount of the element itself diminishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assumption behind this model is that the rate of decay of an element at a particular time is directly proportional to the amount of the element present at that time.
      In other words, the more of the element there is,
      the faster the element decays.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is precisely the same kind of hypothesis which drives The Law of Uninhibited Growth,

      the equation governing radioactive decay is hauntingly similar to <xref ref="lawofuninhibitedgrowth">Equation</xref>

          Iodine-131 is a commonly used radioactive isotope used to help detect how well the thyroid is functioning.
          Suppose the decay of Iodine-131 follows the model given in <xref ref="radioactivedecay">Equation</xref>,
          and that the half-life<fn>
          The time it takes for half of the substance to decay.
          </fn> of Iodine-131 is approximately <m>8</m> days.
          If <m>5</m> grams of Iodine-131 is present initially,

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since we start with <m>5</m> grams initially,
          <xref ref="radioactivedecay">Equation</xref> gives <m>A(t) = 5e^{kt}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the half-life is <m>8</m> days,
          it takes <m>8</m> days for half of the Iodine-131 to decay,
          leaving half of it behind.
          Mathematically, this translates to
          <m>A(8) = 2.5</m>, or <m>5e^{8k} = 2.5</m>.
          We get <m>k = \frac{1}{8} \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\ln(2)}{8} \approx -0.08664</m>,
          which we can interpret as a loss of material at a rate of <m>8.664 \%</m> daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, our final answer is <m>A(t) = 5 e^{-\frac{t\ln(2)}{8}} \approx 5 e^{-0.08664t}</m>.

      We now turn our attention to some more mathematically sophisticated models.
      One such model is Newton's Law of Cooling,
      which we first encountered in <xref ref="exptempex">Example</xref>
      of <xref ref="ExponentialFunctions">Section</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that example we had a cup of coffee cooling from <m>160^{\circ}\mbox{F}</m> to room temperature
      <m>70^{\circ}\mbox{F}</m> according to the formula <m>T(t) = 70 + 90 e^{-0.1 t}</m>,
      where <m>t</m> was measured in minutes.
      In that situation,
      we knew the physical limit of the temperature of the coffee was room temperature,<fn>
      The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that heat can spontaneously flow from a hotter object to a colder one,
      but not the other way around.
      Thus, the coffee could not continue to release heat into the air so as to cool below room temperature.
      </fn> and the differential equation which gives rise to our formula for <m>T(t)</m> takes this into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the radioactive decay model had a rate of decay at time <m>t</m> directly proportional to the amount of the element which remained at time <m>t</m>, Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of the coffee at a given time <m>t</m> is directly proportional to how much of a temperature <em>gap</em>
      exists between the coffee at time <m>t</m> and room temperature,
      not the temperature of the coffee itself.
      In other words, the coffee cools faster when it is first served,
      and as its temperature nears room temperature,
      the coffee cools ever more slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, if we take an item from the refrigerator and let it sit out in the kitchen,
      the object's temperature will rise to room temperature,
      and since the physics behind warming and cooling is the same,
      we combine both cases in the equation below.

                The environment in which we are placing the roast is the

      The function <m>T</m> in this situation is sometimes called a <idx><h>growth model</h><h>limited</h></idx>
      <em>limited</em> growth model,
      since the function <m>T</m> remains bounded as <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>.
      If we apply the principles behind Newton's Law of Cooling to a biological example,
      it says the growth rate of a population is directly proportional to how much room the population has to grow.
      In other words, the more room for expansion,
      the faster the growth rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our final model, the <em>logistic</em>
      growth model combines The Law of Uninhibited Growth with limited growth and states that the rate of growth of a population varies jointly with the population itself as well as the room the population has to grow.

                <m>N(0)</m> corresponds to <m>3</m> people.
                Since <m>t=0</m> corresponds to April 1, 2016,

                and identify <m>L = 84</m>.
                However, to see better <em>why</em>
                the answer is <m>84</m>, we proceed analytically.
                Since the domain of <m>N</m> is restricted to <m>t \geq 0</m>,
                the only end behavior of significance is <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>.
                As we've seen before,<fn>
                See, for example, <xref ref="exptempex">Example</xref>.
                </fn> as <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>,
                we have <m>1997 e^{-t} \rightarrow 0^{+}</m> and so <m>N(t) \approx \frac{84}{1 + \text{ very small \((+)\) } } \approx 84</m>.
                Hence, as <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>,
                <m>N(t) \rightarrow 84</m>.
                This means that as time goes by,
                the number of people who will have heard the rumor approaches <m>8400</m>.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                To find how long it takes until <m>4200</m> people have heard the rumor,
                we set <m>N(t) = 42</m>.
                Solving <m>\frac{84}{1+2799e^{-t}} = 42</m> gives <m>t = \ln(2799) \approx 7.937</m>,

      If we take the time to analyze the graph of <m>y=N(t)</m> in <xref ref="rumorex">Example</xref>,
      we can see <em>graphically</em>
      how logistic growth combines features of uninhibited and limited growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curve is concave up, rising steeply,
      then at some point, becomes concave down and begins to level off.<fn>
      We introduced the notion of concavity in <xref ref="PowerFunctions">Section</xref>.
      </fn> The point at which this happens is called an
          <idx><h>inflection point</h></idx>
          <idx><h>point of diminishing returns</h></idx> <em>inflection point</em> or is sometimes called the <sq>point of diminishing returns</sq>.
      Even though the function is still increasing through the inflection point,
      the <em>rate</em> at which it does so begins to decrease.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Calculus,
      one can show the point of diminishing returns always occurs at half the limiting population. (In our case,
      when <m>N(t)=42</m>.) So with that in mind,
      we present two portions of the graph of <m>y=N(x)</m>,
      one on the interval <m>[0,8]</m>,
      the other on <m>[8,15]</m>.
      The former looks strikingly like uninhibited growth while the latter like limited growth.

      Buffer solutions have a wide variety of applications from maintaining a healthy fish tank to regulating the pH levels in blood.

          Blood is a buffer solution.
          When carbon dioxide is absorbed into the bloodstream it produces carbonic acid and lowers the pH. The body compensates by producing bicarbonate,
          a weak base to partially neutralize the acid.

          We get <m>x = \frac{800}{10^{1.3}} \approx 40.09</m>.

      To answer these questions,
      scientists often use logarithms in an attempt to <sq>linearize</sq> non-liner data sets such as the one before us.
      To see how this could work,
      suppose we guessed the relationship between <m>N</m> and <m>t</m> is something from <xref ref="PowerFunctions">Section</xref>,
      <m>N(t) = a t^{p}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking the natural logs of both sides and using the Product and Power Rules, in turn,
      we find that <m>\ln(N(t)) = \ln(a t^p) = \ln(a) + \ln(t^p) = \ln(a) + p \ln(t) =  p \ln(t) + \ln(a)</m>.
      If we let <m>x = \ln(t)</m> and <m>y= \ln(N(t))</m>,
      the model takes the form <m>y = p x + \ln(a)</m> which is a <em>linear</em>
      model with slope <m>p</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>\ln(a)</m>.
      So, instead of plotting <m>N(t)</m> versus <m>t</m>,
      we plot <m>y=\ln(N(t))</m> versus

      We see <m>r=0.991</m>,
      which is very close to <m>1</m> indicating a very good fit.
      The slope of the regression line is
      <m>m \approx 1.512</m> which corresponds to our exponent <m>p</m>.
      The <m>y</m>-intercept <m>b \approx 4.513</m> corresponds to <m>\ln(a)</m>,
      so that <m>a \approx 91.201</m>.
      Hence, we get the model <m>N = 91.201 t^{1.512}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of interest here is that the graphing utility we used,
      <url href="https://www.desmos.com"><em>desmos</em></url>
      has its own built-in power regression model.
      If the <sq>log mode</sq> square is checked,
      the graphing utility returns the <em>same</em>
      model we obtained using our linearization (since the routine which determines the coefficients uses logarithms as well.)<fn>
      If, however, we uncheck that box,
      we get a <em>different</em> power function model,
      <m>N(t) = 62.318 t^{1.675}</m> which chooses <m>a</m> and <m>p</m> directly to minimize the total squared error.
      See
      <url href="http://support.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/204349605"><em>here</em></url>
      for more details.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, the quadratic model fits the data better,
      ostensibly because we have <em>three</em>
      parameters we can adjust in the formula
      <m>N(t) = at^2+bt+c</m> to minimize our error as opposed to just <em>two</em>
      parameters in the formula <m>N(t) = a t^{p}</m>.
      Neither model,
      however, is based on any underlying scientific principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we think about this situation from a scientific perspective,
      it does seem to make sense that,
      at least in the early stages of the outbreak,
      the more people who have the flu,
      the faster it will spread.
      This suggests we fit the data to an uninhibited growth model.
    </p>
    <p>
      As written, <xref ref="lawofuninhibitedgrowth">Equation</xref>
      gives uninhibited growth as <m>N(t) = N_{0}e^{kt}</m>.
      Here, for simplicity's sake,
      we relabel <m>N_{0} = a</m> and
      <m>e^{k} = b</m> so that we are looking for parameters <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> so that <m>N(t) = a \cdot b^{t}</m>.
      If we assume <m>N(t) = a \cdot b^{t}</m> then,
      taking logs as before, we get <m>\ln(N(t)) = t \ln(b) + \ln(a)</m>.
      If we let <m>y= \ln(N(t))</m>, then, once again,
      we get a linear model this time with slope <m>\ln(b)</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>\ln(a)</m>.
      We present the results of the regression below.
      While there is a strong correlation, <m>r = 0.962</m>,
      the plot doesn't instill the greatest of confidence in this model.

      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      From the slope of the model,
      we have <m>m = \ln(b) \approx 0.202</m> so <m>b \approx 1.223</m>.
      From the <m>y</m>-intercept of the model,
      we get <m>B = \ln(a) \approx 5.596</m> so <m>a \approx 269.35</m>,
      so that our model is <m>N(t) = 269.35(1.223)^{t}</m>.
      Using the built-in exponential regression (again,
      with <sq>log mode</sq> checked) returns the model <m>N(t) = 269.41 (1.223)^{t}</m>,
      the discrepancy between <m>269.35</m> and <m>269.41</m> stemming ostensibly from round-off error.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exponential model didn't fit the data as well as the quadratic or power function model,
      but it stands to reason that, perhaps,
      the spread of the flu is not unlike that of the spread of a rumor and that a logistic model can be used to model the data.
      Again, for simplicity,
      we abbreviate the model given in <xref ref="logisticgrowth">Equation</xref>
      from <m>N(t) =\frac{L}{1 + Ce^{-kLt}}</m> to <m>N(t) = \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{Kt}}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running the data,
      a logistic function appears to be an excellent fit,
      both judging by the graph as well as the coefficient of determination,
      <m>R^2 \approx 0.995</m>.
      Moreover, the underlying principles which lead to the formulation of this model seem reasonable enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <image width="93%" source="./ApplicationsofExponentialandLogarithmicFunctionsGraphics/ExpLogAppEx08.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      While the quadratic model also fits extremely well,
      our logistic model takes into account that only a finite number of people will ever get the flu
      (according to our model, <m>L=10,\!739</m>),
      whereas the quadratic model predicts no limit to the number of cases.
      As we have stated several times before in the text,
      mathematical models, regardless of their sophistication,
      are just that:
      models, and they all have their limitations.<fn>
      Speaking of limitations, as of June 3, 2009,
      there were 19,273 confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1).
      This is well above our prediction of 10,739.
      Each time a new report is issued,
      the data set increases and the model must be recalculated.
      We leave this recalculation to the reader.

          The Law of Uninhibited Growth also applies to situations where an animal is re-introduced into a suitable environment.
          Such a case is the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park.
          According to the
          <url href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/wolves.htm"><em>National Park Service</em></url>,
          the wolf population in Yellowstone National Park was 52 in 1996 and 118 in 1999.
          Using these data, find a function of the form
          <m>N(t) = N_{\text{ \tiny \(0\) } } e^{kt}</m> which models the number of wolves <m>t</m> years after 1996. (Use <m>t = 0</m> to represent the year 1996.
          Also, round your value of <m>k</m> to four decimal places.) According to the model,
          how many wolves were in Yellowstone in 2002? (The recorded number is 272.)

          During the early years of a community,
          it is not uncommon for the population to grow according to the Law of Uninhibited Growth.

          in 1860, the Village of Painesville had a population of 2649.
          In 1920, the population was 7272.

          Also, round the value of <m>k</m> to four decimal places.) According to this model,
          what was the population of Painesville in 2010? (The 2010 census gave the population as 19,563) What could be some causes for such a vast discrepancy?

                How does this model compare with the model you found in <xref ref="PainesvillePopulationTwoPoint">Exercise</xref>?
                Use the graphing utility's exponential model to predict the population in 2010. (The 2010 census gave the population as 19,563)

          According to
          <url href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?timeline"><em>facebook</em></url>,
          the number of active users of facebook has grown significantly since its initial launch from a Harvard dorm room in February 2004.
          The chart below has the approximate number <m>U(x)</m> of active users,
          in <em>millions</em>, <m>x</m> months after February 2004.
          For example,
          the first entry <m>(10, 1)</m> means that there were <m>1</m> million active users in December 2004 and the last entry
          <m>(77, 500)</m> means that there were <m>500</m> million active users in July 2010.

          Each Monday during the registration period before the Fall Semester at LCCC, the Enrollment Planning Council gets a report prepared by the data analysts in Institutional Effectiveness and Planning.<fn>
          Thanks to Dr.
          Wendy Marley and her staff for this data and Dr.
          Marcia Ballinger for the permission to use it in this problem.
          </fn>  While the ongoing enrollment data is analyzed in many different ways,
          we shall focus only on the overall headcount.
          Below is a chart of the enrollment data for Fall Semester 2008.
          It starts 21 weeks before
          <q>Opening Day</q>
          and ends on
          <q>Day 15</q>
          of the semester,
          but we have relabeled the top row to be <m>x = 1</m> through <m>x = 24</m> so that the math is easier.
          (Thus, <m>x = 22</m> is Opening Day.)

          With the help of your classmates,
          find a model for this data.
          Unlike most of the phenomena we have studied in this section,
          there is no single differential equation which governs the enrollment growth.
          Thus there is no scientific reason to rely on a logistic function even though the data plot may lead us to that model.
          What are some factors which influence enrollment at a community college and how can you take those into account mathematically?

          When we wrote this exercise,
          the Enrollment Planning Report for Fall Semester 2009 had only 10 data points for the first 10 weeks of the registration period.
          Those numbers are given below.

          find a model for this data and make a prediction for the Opening Day enrollment as well as the Day 15 enrollment. (WARNING: The registration period for 2009 was one week shorter than it was in 2008 so Opening Day would be <m>x = 21</m> and Day 15 is <m>x = 23</m>.)

          This is due to the presence of the <m>\ln(x)</m> term in the function.
          This means that Fritzy will never catch Chewbacca,
          which makes sense since Chewbacca has a head start and Fritzy only runs as fast as he does.

              We get: <m>y = 2895.06 (1.0147)^{x}</m>.
              Graphing this along with our answer from <xref ref="PainesvillePopulationTwoPoint">Exercise</xref>
              over the interval <m>[0,60]</m> shows that they are pretty close.
              From this model,
              <m>y(150) \approx 25840</m> which once again overshoots the actual data value.

            <p>
              <m>P(150) \approx 18717</m>,
              so this model predicts 17,914 people in Painesville in 2010,
              a more conservative number than was recorded in the 2010 census.
              As <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>,
              <m>P(t) \rightarrow 18691</m>.
              So the limiting population of Painesville based on this model is 18,691 people.
